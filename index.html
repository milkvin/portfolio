			<h2>A Cup of Tea</h2>
			<center>A twenty two year-old girl, graduated from architecture in Jan 2019. She started the post-campus journey as a research assistant in her campus urban laboratory.</br>
			After the research ended, she started her own journey, exploring architectural experience as an intern, redesigning restaurant and a foodcourt with a natural concept.</br>
			As the opportunity come, she participated in JKTWS 2019, the goal is redesigning Kampung Cikini, in collaboration with University of Tokyo and Keio University, Japan.
			What is so good about it? Other than she could explore more about social and architectural experience, she got an opportunity to test her Japanese that was JLPT N4. At the same time, she also took Spanish class from the beginner level.
			<br>As she moved on with her first full-time job, she got interested into financial and IT. She started to take classes online, and got certificate.
			<br>Why financial and IT all of sudden? I forgot to mention that she started to be financial literate and tried to dive more in it. For IT, she used to design website in her middle school time, and it hit her that IT would be needed in the future, other than HTML&CSS, she also learned Javascript and Python.
			<br>Wait, so why is she learning so many things? <b>Well, because being stuck is suck, you know.</b>
