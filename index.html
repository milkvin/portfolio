			<h2>A Cup of <del>Tea</del> Water</h2>
			<center>If you are wondering about the title, yes, I write 'water' instead, because it is the healthiest drink and I drink water with a cup (it is the cheapest at the store) but sometimes with a tumblr (so I don't need to refill every 1 minute).
			<br>A twenty two year-old girl, graduated from architecture in Jan 2019. She started the post-campus journey as a research assistant in her campus urban laboratory.</br>
			After the research ended, she started her own walk, exploring architectural experience as an intern, redesigning restaurant and a foodcourt with a natural concept (handled the concept for 2 projects).</br>
			As the time and opportunity met, she participated in JKTWS 2019, the goal is redesigning Kampung Cikini (slum area in Central Jakarta), in collaboration with University of Tokyo and Keio University, Japan.
			What is so good about it? Other than she could explore more about social and architectural experience, she got an opportunity to test her Japanese that was JLPT N4. At the same time, she also took Spanish class from the beginner level.
			<br>As she moved on with her first full-time job and drowned into reality, she got interested into financial and tried to dive with it. She focused more in asset management for individual (in case you need someone to consult with).
			<br>Where else did she dive into? So, this girl used to design website when she was in middle school, and then the memory hit her so hard that she also learning Javascript and Python now.
			<br>"Wait, so why is she learning so many things?" <i>Memento mori, carpe diem.</i> Yes, she is also into philosophy.
